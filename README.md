# Problem Statement: From Production Logs to Safe, SOTA-Aligned Training Data

This document describes the **problem space** for turning real usage logs into high-quality training data—after privacy-safe processing—so that fine-tuned or post-trained models improve on both **question answering** and **agentic** behavior.

---

## One-line goal

**Ingest logs → remove PII → build a trajectory-oriented pipeline** (controlled diversity plus explicit **trajectory-complexity scheduling**) **that exports SFT (LoRA) and DPO–ready data**, improves behavior, and supports training a **smaller replacement model**—all without leaking sensitive information.

---

## Context

- **Sources:** Application logs that mix **direct Q&A** (user question, model answer, possibly retrieval context) with **agentic sessions** (multi-turn dialogue, tool or API calls, environment feedback, partial failures, retries, and setup/configuration steps).
- **Constraint:** Logs contain **personally identifiable information (PII)** and possibly sensitive business data. Nothing that identifies individuals or confidential entities should reach training stores or third-party trainers without explicit policy, consent, and technical controls.
- **Outcome:** A **repeatable pipeline** that produces datasets suitable for **state-of-the-art (SOTA) practice**: not merely “pairs of strings,” but **trajectory-shaped** supervision where needed, distributions and splits, **tags for compositional complexity** (steps, tools, recovery), diversity guarantees, and—where relevant—**verifiable multi-turn traces** aligned with how capable agents are trained and evaluated. Exported data should be usable **without rework** in common **SFT (LoRA)** and **DPO** stacks (e.g. Hugging Face `datasets` + PEFT / TRL-style trainers), and structured so a **student** model can later match the **teacher** behavior seen in production.

This repository (or project folder) is a **staging ground** for defining requirements, experiments, and eventually implementations for that pipeline—not necessarily the final training code itself.


## Core sub-problems

### 1. Log understanding and segmentation

- **Normalize** heterogeneous log formats (JSON, plain text, tracing spans) into a common **event schema** (user turn, assistant turn, tool invocation, tool result, system message, errors).
- **Segment** continuous streams into **training units**: single-turn Q&A, multi-turn threads, and **agent trajectories** (tool graphs, not only final answers).
- **Label or infer metadata** where possible: task type, domain, language, success/failure, latency, tool names, number of hops—without re-identifying users.

### 2. PII removal and privacy-preserving use

- **Discover** PII (names, emails, phone numbers, addresses, IDs, URLs with tokens, free-text secrets) using rules, NER, and organization-specific dictionaries.
- **Redact or replace** with consistent placeholders (e.g. synthetic tokens) so that **statistics and linguistic patterns** remain useful while **identifiers** do not.
- **Audit:** sampling and human review for false negatives; document what was removed and residual risk (e.g. rare indirect identification).
- Align with **data retention, purpose limitation, and subprocessors** policies before any export for training.

### 3. From cleaned logs to training examples

Depending on the training stage, targets may include:

| Stage / objective | Typical data derived from logs |
|-------------------|--------------------------------|
| **SFT (LoRA) — Q&A** | Instruction → response, or short multi-turn chat in the same template as inference. |
| **SFT (LoRA) — agentic** | **Full or segmented trajectories** in chat/tool format: state → action (tool) → observation → next action; behavior-cloning targets from successful (or corrected) rollouts. |
| **Preference / DPO** | Shared prefix plus **chosen vs. rejected** suffixes: edits, thumbs, failed vs. successful trace for same intent, or governed synthetic negatives. |
| **Evaluation** | Held-out sets mirroring production **mix** by **trajectory complexity** and tool mix, not only loss on text. |

### Training-method compatibility: SFT (LoRA) and DPO

The pipeline should treat **export formats** as first-class requirements so the same underlying examples (or parallel views) can feed **supervised fine-tuning with LoRA** and **Direct Preference Optimization** without ad-hoc rewrites.

**SFT (LoRA):**

- Emit **standard chat or completion records** (e.g. `messages` arrays or prompt/completion pairs) that match **inference-time templates** exactly: same system prompt structure, tool-call syntax, stop tokens, and tokenizer chat template as the trainer requires
- **Multi-turn** agent rows should be valid **full trajectories** in one training example where the trainer expects that—so LoRA updates see tool boundaries and user/assistant alternation consistently.
- LoRA is a **parameter-efficiency** choice at train time; the dataset itself is still **standard SFT JSON/JSONL**—the pipeline documents one canonical schema and optional shims for specific libraries.

**DPO:**

- Each preference row needs a **shared prompt** (conversation prefix up to the last user turn, or equivalent) plus **chosen** and **rejected** completions—full strings or message suffixes as required by the DPO implementation 
- **Sources of pairs** from logs: explicit thumbs up/down, edits that replace model text, successful vs. failed trajectories for the same intent, or **synthetic** rejections (policy-violating or tool-wrong) generated under governance—always with **PII already stripped** from both branches.
- **Balance and length:** Chosen/rejected should be comparable where possible (avoid trivial “reject = empty string” unless that is the real product behavior) so the reward model implicit in DPO is not dominated by length or formatting artifacts.

**Shared constraints for both methods:**

- Same **tokenization and chat template** assumptions across SFT and DPO exports for a given training run.
- **Splits** that prevent leakage of near-identical prompts across SFT pretrain mix and DPO preference sets if both are built from the same logs.

## Success criteria (what “done” looks like for the problem, not one script)

1. **Privacy:** Documented PII handling; measurable redaction quality; no training on raw secrets.
2. **Coverage:** Explicit diversity and **trajectory-complexity targets** and reporting (not only row counts).
3. **Scheduling-ready:** Examples or shards tagged so trainers can run **flat mixtures**, **staged phases**, or **model-aware** sampling over complexity—not a single brittle static sort.
4. **Agent-ready:** Tool-use trajectories validate against schemas and, where possible, **execution** or outcome checks.
5. **Evaluation:** Held-out and behavioral metrics show improvement without regressions on safety or format.
6. **Training exports:** Documented, validated **SFT (LoRA-ready)** and **DPO-ready** dataset schemas (including multi-turn agent rows where applicable).
7. **Student path:** Clear subset of data and eval criteria aimed at **matching teacher behavior** with a **smaller** deployable model in the same setup.


## Next steps (for implementers)

1. Define the **canonical log schema** and **PII taxonomy** for your product.
2. Prototype **redaction** and measure **residual PII** on a sample.
3. Build a **small gold set** (human-curated) for Q&A and for **one** representative agent workflow; align all automated extraction to match that quality bar.
4. Add **tagging** (compositional complexity, domain, tools, outcome) and report **diversity** and **trajectory-scheduling** coverage before scaling volume.
5. Specify **one SFT JSONL schema** and **one DPO JSONL schema** (and chat template) validated end-to-end with a **LoRA** dry run and a **small DPO** dry run on toy data.
6. Define **student model** constraints (context length, tool set) and a **filter + eval** plan for teacher-to-student parity before production swap.

## Prototype implementation

This repository now includes an initial Python-first prototype that covers the first end-to-end slice of the pipeline:

- JSON/JSONL log ingestion and normalization into a canonical event schema
- deterministic rule-based PII redaction with consistent placeholders
- session segmentation into Q&A units and agent trajectories
- trajectory complexity tagging for staged training schedules
- basic validation for tool-call consistency
- SFT JSONL export and governed DPO candidate export

The code intentionally uses only the Python standard library for the first pass so it can run in constrained environments and be reviewed without dependency setup.

### Quickstart

```bash
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
training-setup-logs examples/sample_agent_logs.jsonl --out-dir out
```

Outputs:

- `out/redacted_units.jsonl`: canonical redacted units for audit and downstream transforms
- `out/sft.jsonl`: LoRA-ready supervised chat rows
- `out/dpo_candidates.jsonl`: preference-pair candidates that require human approval
- `out/redaction_report.json`: PII finding kinds and placeholders, without raw sensitive values
- `out/manifest.json`: PII counts, validation counts, and complexity distribution

Run tests:

```bash
python -m pytest
```

See [docs/schema.md](docs/schema.md) for the initial canonical schema and privacy assumptions.
